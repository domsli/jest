How to pass down the flag into the code?

setFromArgv.ts might be what is used to set into Config.InitialOptions

normalize.ts consumes setFromArgv. In this, the type is somehow merged from Argv to InitialOptions to AllOptions = ProjectConfig & GlobalConfig

jest-config/index.ts consumes normalize

jestAdapterInit.ts has the `initialize` method which sets SnapshotState based on the globalConfig 

What is the condition for having obsolete snapshots?

getSnapshotStatus and getSnapshotSummary seems to have the conditions. What is the difference between the two?

From getSnapshotSummary, the condition is: (unchecked && !didUpdate) || (filesRemoved && !didUpdate)
From getSnapshotStatus, the condition is: (unchecked && !afterUpdate)
  - According to DefaultReporter.ts, afterUpdate = this._globalConfig.updateSnapshot === 'all'

The unchecked and filedRemoved etc. come from SnapshotSummary. Part of the question is how are these populated.

I think the answer stems from TestScheduler where the tests are run...




Maybe jest-reporters utils.ts has something It is very similar to getSnapshotSummary/Status in that it also has strings for reporting
